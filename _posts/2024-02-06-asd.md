# K3s Cluster Deployment


## Prerequisites

For minimal cluster, I use 1 master and 3 worker nodes. The naming in K3s is a little different. Master = Server and Worker = Agent, keep in mind.

|Hostname|IP|vCPU|Memory|Disk|OS|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|master-node01|192.168.1.130|4|8|50 GB|Ubuntu 22.04 LTS|
|worker-node01|192.168.1.131|4|8|100 GB|Ubuntu 22.04 LTS|
|worker-node02|192.168.1.132|4|8|100 GB|Ubuntu 22.04 LTS|
|worker-node03|192.168.1.133|4|8|100 GB|Ubuntu 22.04 LTS|


You can use cloud init or template image for all the nodes. Of course you can configure them all from scrath.

All the nodes need to be updated and nfs package must be installed because later on we will need it while playing with Longhorn.

Below, you can see commands for Debian based distros.
~~~
 # stop the software firewall
 systemctl stop ufw
 systemctl disable ufw

 # get updates, install nfs, and apply
 apt update
 apt install nfs-common -y
 apt upgrade -y

 # clean up
 apt autoremove -y
~~~


## Installing K3s Cluster

The easiest way is to use K3s install scripts but you can check their documentation for several different ways. 

While using install scripts, you can state options with --option syntax. With my below example, my command will install K3s with specific "version", as "server" and with "NoSchedule" tagging. I don't want any pod workload on my master node. Here is the offical documentation link, you can play the options if you need more specification [K3s Official Documentation](https://docs.k3s.io/installation/configuration)

~~~bash
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | INSTALL_K3S_VERSION="v1.26.12+k3s1" sh -s - server --node-taint 'node-role.kubernetes.io/master=true:NoSchedule'
~~~  

This script will install Traefik as an ingress controller, Flannel as CNI and SQLite as key-value database. If you wish to use **etcd** as an embeeded DB, you can use --cloud-init option. Check for documentation from this [link](https://docs.k3s.io/datastore/ha-embedded?_highlight=etcd).

If everything goes well then below command will show you your master (server) node status as ready.
~~~bash
kubectl get nodes
~~~ 
Then you need to copy your token in order to add agents to your cluster. Just go to below path and copy out your token ID. 

~~~bash
cat /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/token
~~~

The next command will install agent role to your worker(agent) nodes. You need to run same command with related IPs and same token on each of your servers.

~~~bash
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | K3S_TOKEN="MASTER_NODE_TOKEN" K3S_URL="https://MASTER_NODE_IP:6443" K3S_NODE_NAME="worker-node01" INSTALL_K3S_VERSION="v1.26.12+k3s1" sh -
~~~

So, your cluster is ready to use. You can check your fresh worker(agent) nodes status like below. You will see them in **Ready** state, if you got no error while executing scripts on each of them. 

~~~
root@master-node01:/home/stigmata# kubectl get nodes
NAME            STATUS   ROLES                  AGE   VERSION
master-node01   Ready    control-plane,master   21d   v1.26.12+k3s1
worker-node04   Ready    <none>                 12d   v1.26.12+k3s1
worker-node01   Ready    <none>                 21d   v1.26.12+k3s1
worker-node02   Ready    <none>                 21d   v1.26.12+k3s1
~~~

## What to do now ? 

Finally you get your K3s cluster up and running. Now according to your needs (or just fun) you can install Rancher to manage your cluster via practical GUI and/or deploy Lognhorn to use as a storage cluster for your persistent volumes. 

Take care till the next post : )
