# K3s Cluster Deployment


## Prerequisites

For minimal cluster, I use 1 master and 3 worker nodes. The naming in K3s is a little different. Master = Server and Worker = Agent, keep in mind.

|Hostname|IP|vCPU|Memory|Disk|OS|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|master-node01|192.168.1.130|4|8|50 GB|Ubuntu 22.04 LTS|
|worker-node01|192.168.1.131|4|8|100 GB|Ubuntu 22.04 LTS|
|worker-node02|192.168.1.132|4|8|100 GB|Ubuntu 22.04 LTS|
|worker-node03|192.168.1.133|4|8|100 GB|Ubuntu 22.04 LTS|


You can use cloud init or template image for all the nodes. Of course you can configure them all from scrath.

All the nodes need to be updated and nfs package must be installed because later on we will need it while playing with Longhorn.

Below, you can see commands for Debian based distros.
~~~
 # stop the software firewall
 systemctl stop ufw
 systemctl disable ufw

 # get updates, install nfs, and apply
 apt update
 apt install nfs-common -y
 apt upgrade -y

 # clean up
 apt autoremove -y

## Installing K3s Cluster

The easiest way is to use K3s install scripts but you can check their documentation for several different ways. 

While using install scripts, you can state options with --option syntax. With my below example, my command will install K3s with specific "version", as "server" and with "NoSchedule" tagging. I don't want any pod workload on my master node. Here is the offical documentation link, you can play the options if you need more specification [K3s Official Documentation](https://docs.k3s.io/installation/configuration)

~~~bash
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | INSTALL_K3S_VERSION="v1.26.12+k3s1" sh -s - server --node-taint 'node-role.kubernetes.io/master=true:NoSchedule'
~~~  



~~~bash
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | K3S_TOKEN="MASTER_NODE_TOKEN" K3S_URL="https://MASTER_NODE_IP:6443" K3S_NODE_NAME="worker-node01" INSTALL_K3S_VERSION="v1.26.12+k3s1" sh -
